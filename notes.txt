Complex types notes:Class:-Is a template for creating an object.-Class instances-Use access modifiers to control encapsulation-Methods manipulates state and performs operationsFields store objects-Interactions are normally controlled through accessor (getters) and mutators (setters)Constructors – set initiated stateAssesors and MutatorsTo control access – use getters and settersEncapsulation –  internal representations are hidden by using  access modifiersPublic – visible every wherePrivate – only within class (not visible from outside)Public class Flight{      private int passengers;      private int seats;            public int getSeats()      {return seats}            public void setSeats(int seats)      {      this.seats = seats;      }}Question: If Class is default can we name the file with a different name?Methods – name with verb names e.g getFlights-returns type- if void no return-type parameter list can be empty or can also have a list-have bracketsEXIT-End od statements-Return statement-Error occursWhen not void method:-Returns a single value-Primitive-Reference object-Arrays object
