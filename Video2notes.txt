Initialization and Constructor OrderSummary* Objects should be created in some state* Field initialization provide an initial value as part of the declaration* Every class has at least one contractoro if no explicit constructor, Java provides one with no argumentso you can provide multiple constructors with differing argument lists* One constructor can call anothero Call next be first line* Initialization blocks share code across constructors* Keep the initialization and construction order in mind Chain contractor example: Public class Passenger() {      This.freebags = freebags;}public Passenger ( int freebags, int checkedBags) {      this(freebags);      this.checkedBags = checkedBags;}Example of Initialization Blocks:public class Flight {private int passengers, flightNumber, seats = 150;private char flightClass;private Boolean[] isSeatAvailable;{//inialization blockisSeatAvailable[i] = new Boolean[seat];for (int i=0; i< seats; I++)isSeatAvailable[i] = true;}public Flight() {}public Flight(int flightNumber) {this.flightNumber = flightNumber;} public Flight(char flightClass){this.flightClass = flightClass;}}
